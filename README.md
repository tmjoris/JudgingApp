# JudgingApp
The platform is meant to simulate a Leaderboard. The main page is at
http://leaderboardkali.tech:8080/public/scoreboard.html<br>
But only judges can assign points to Particpants.
The judge login page is at
http://leaderboardkali.tech:8080/judge/judgelogin.html  <br>
Still only the admin can create judges, and the admin page is at
http://leaderboardkali.tech:8080/admin/adminlogin.html
